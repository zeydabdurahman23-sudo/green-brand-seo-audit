# Case Study: SEO & Social Strategy for "Green" E-commerce 🌿

## 🎯 Project Overview
I developed a comprehensive digital marketing strategy for a sustainable startup. The goal was to increase organic visibility and drive high-intent traffic by positioning the brand as a "Climate Guard."

## 🔍 SEO Strategy: Finding the "Gap"
Instead of competing for broad, high-volume terms, I targeted **Low Competition / High Intent** keywords to reach customers ready to buy.

| Keyword | Competition | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reusable water bottle | Very High | Avoided (Too competitive) |
| **Non-toxic water bottle brands** | **Low** | **Primary Target** |

### On-Page Optimization
* **Title Tag**: Non-Toxic Water Bottle Brands | Pure Water, Climate Guard
* **Meta Description**: Looking for the best non-toxic water bottle brands? Protect your health and the planet with our pollution-free designs. Drink health itself.

## 📱 Social Media & UGC Strategy
Focused on **Instagram** to build a community around sustainability.
* **Content Pillar**: User-Generated Content (UGC) showing the product in "lifestyle" settings.
* **Campaign**: "7-Day Plastic-Free Challenge" to boost engagement and Click-Through Rate (CTR).

## ⚙️ Technical Recommendations
* **Image Optimization**: Identified that large product images caused a 10-second load time, which decreases SEO rankings. Recommended compression to improve user retention and Google ranking.
